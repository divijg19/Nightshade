## The Program

`Nightshade` is not advertised as a game.

It is presented as a **broadcast experiment**, aired in controlled cycles and observed by an unseen audience. Participants are referred to as **entities**. Episodes are referred to as **runs**.

You are not told how you were selected.
You are not told who is watching.

Only that observation has begun.

---

## The Stage

The setting is called **the Shade**.

The Shade is a sealed, artificial world rendered as a finite grid. It contains no sky, no horizon, and no sense of scale beyond what you can personally verify.

The world does not feel broken.
It feels *complete*.

Walls exist where they must. Corridors narrow when they should. Open spaces feel exposed, as though they were designed to be watched from afar.

The environment does not react to emotion.
It reacts only to action.

---

## The Camera

You never see the whole stage.

Your perception is limited:

* by distance
* by obstacles
* by the program’s discretion

Some things are shown clearly.
Others are implied through sound, absence, or delay.

Occasionally, the broadcast lingers where you are not looking.

---

## The Entities

Every moving figure in the Shade is an **entity**.

Some speak through terminals.
Some move without explanation.
Some hesitate, adapt, or retreat.

The program makes no distinction between:

* participant
* performer
* synthetic construct

If a difference exists, it is for the audience—not you.

---

## Identity Erosion

Names are not persistent.

You are known by:

* position
* behavior
* survival time

If you disappear, the broadcast continues uninterrupted.

The audience is trained not to mourn.

---

## The Rules (As Announced)

Before each run, the same message appears:

> *“All entities are subject to identical constraints.”*

### Movement

Entities may relocate one unit at a time.
Every movement is logged.

### Actions

Entities may interact with their environment in limited, sanctioned ways:

* acquisition
* concealment
* confrontation
* observation

Every action leaves evidence.

### Resources

The Shade provides just enough to continue.
Never enough to feel secure.

Scarcity is not a bug.
It is a feature of the format.

---

## Energy & Cost

Nothing is free.

Every action drains a measurable reserve.
Running out does not kill you.

It only limits what you are allowed to express.

---

## Conflict

Violence is permitted.

It is not encouraged.

The broadcast notes that aggressive entities:

* are easier to track
* produce simpler data
* often exit early

Still, conflict remains a recurring highlight.

---

## Elimination

When an entity’s tolerance for damage is exceeded, they are removed.

There is no announcement.
No slow motion.
No farewell shot.

One moment they are present.
The next, the frame holds empty space.

The audience is instructed to take note.

---

## The Learning Curve

Some entities improve.

They:

* stop repeating mistakes
* adapt to scarcity
* alter approach patterns

The program never clarifies whether this is:

* intelligence
* memory
* training
* imitation

Only that the behavior has changed.

---

## The Suspicion

Viewers are encouraged to speculate.

> *“That one waited too long.”*
> *“That one learned the corner.”*
> *“That one doesn’t move like the others.”*

Within the Shade, entities are left to wonder the same.

---

## Win Conditions

There is no universal victory.

Each run may define one or more **success criteria**, disclosed incompletely or not at all.

Common outcomes include:

### Survival

Remain active longer than all others.

### Control

Maintain influence over key zones for an unspecified duration.

### Compliance

Remain within behavioral thresholds without drawing intervention.

### Extraction

Locate and reach an exit before it is revoked.

Success does not guarantee continuation.
Failure does not imply error.

---

## The Audience

You never see them.

But they are referenced:

* in pauses
* in framing
* in what the program chooses to show

The Shade is not cruel.
It is **performative**.

---

## The Ending

Every run ends the same way.

The world freezes.
The feed cuts.
A neutral message appears:

> *“Run complete. Data retained.”*

No scores are displayed.
No rankings are announced.

Some entities are invited back.
Most are not.

---

## Final Notice

`Nightshade` is not about winning.

It is about:

* being observed under constraint
* making decisions without context
* behaving while uncertain who—or what—is watching

If you feel watched, the program is working.

> *Thank you for participating.*
> *Please remain still while the system evaluates your behavior.*
> *Goodb- `tzzt`*
